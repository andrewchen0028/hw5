# Problem Description (40s)
"Our project tackles the challenge of generating realistic images from random noise using diffusion models. This technology forms the foundation of modern AI image generation systems like Stable Diffusion and DALL-E, which have revolutionized creative workflows across industries.

While diffusion models are well-established, implementing them efficiently remains challenging. Our work focuses on a clean, efficient implementation of the core DDPM architecture, aiming to understand the practical tradeoffs in training these models with limited computational resources.

This re-implementation effort provides insights into the scalability and optimization challenges that even state-of-the-art image generation systems must address."

# Task & Dataset (30s)
"We're working with the ImageNet100 dataset, a curated subset of ImageNet containing 100 classes with approximately 130,000 training images. Our preprocessing pipeline resizes these images to 64x64 pixels and normalizes them to the range [-1, 1].

The choice of ImageNet100 gives us enough data variety to learn meaningful features while remaining computationally tractable. This represents a practical middle ground between toy datasets and full-scale training."

# Architecture Overview (30s)
"Let's look at how our implementation works. As shown in this diagram, we start with random noise and pass it through our UNet model. The UNet predicts the noise present in its input, which our scheduler then uses to partially denoise the image. This process repeats multiple times, gradually transforming noise into a coherent image.

During training, shown by these dotted lines, we take real images, add noise, and teach the model to predict that noise. This simple but powerful approach allows the model to learn the reverse process."

# Implementation Details (45s)
"After extensive experimentation, we arrived at a configuration that balanced quality with our computational constraints. We settled on generating 64 by 64 pixel images, using a UNet with 128 base channels. Our diffusion process uses 128 timesteps for both training and inference.

The UNet architecture, shown here, consists of a series of down blocks that process the input at progressively lower resolutions, a middle block that captures global features, and up blocks that reconstruct the image. A key innovation is the timestep embedding, which informs each block about its position in the denoising process.

We found that a batch size of 64 and learning rate of 3e-4 provided stable training on our V100 GPU while maintaining reasonable training times. These parameters emerged from numerous experiments balancing stability, speed, and memory constraints."

# Training Process (45s)
"Our training journey involved significant trial and error. We started small, with 32 by 32 images and minimal model capacity, focusing first on getting the basic pipeline working. These initial attempts often resulted in unstable training or pure noise output.

As we gained confidence in our implementation, we gradually scaled up the model capacity and image size. A crucial breakthrough came when we optimized our batch size specifically for the V100 GPU architecture, allowing us to utilize more of its computational power while maintaining stable gradients.

The loss progression tells an interesting story. Starting around 1.0, indicating pure noise prediction, it quickly dropped to about 0.1 as the model learned basic patterns. The final plateau around 0.028 represented a sweet spot where the model could generate recognizable features while maintaining training stability."

# Results and Discussion (50s)
"The evolution of our generated images revealed interesting insights about diffusion model training. Starting with pure noise, we first saw the emergence of statistical patterns - basic distributions of light and dark areas. This evolved into more structured textures reminiscent of impressionist paintings.

Why did we see this progression? The model first learns to distinguish broad features - light from dark, sky from ground - before tackling more complex patterns. This matches the theoretical understanding that diffusion models learn to denoise in a coarse-to-fine manner.

Our results, while not state-of-the-art, demonstrate that even with limited computational resources, careful parameter tuning can achieve meaningful image generation. The key was finding the right balance between model capacity and training stability."

# Conclusions (30s)
"Our implementation demonstrates both the potential and challenges of diffusion models. While we achieved stable training and recognizable feature generation, the computational demands highlight why services like DALL-E require massive infrastructure.

The real-world impact of this work lies in understanding these practical tradeoffs. As image generation becomes more prevalent in applications from design to education, implementing these models efficiently becomes increasingly important.

Looking forward, obvious improvements would include scaling to higher resolutions and optimizing training speed. Thank you for your attention."
