# Training Process (60s)

Training progression:
- Initial attempts:
  - Small models, 32x32 images
  - High learning rates
  - Unstable results

- Final approach:
  - Gradually increased model capacity
  - Optimized batch size for V100
  - Found stable learning rate
  - Achieved consistent loss reduction

Loss progression:
- Start: ~1.0 (pure noise)
- Mid: ~0.1 (textures emerge)
- Final: ~0.028 (stable, recognizable features)

# Results (50s)

Image Quality Evolution:
- Phase 1: Random noise
- Phase 2: Statistical patterns
- Phase 3: Abstract textures (oil painting quality)
- Phase 4: Recognizable features
  - Landscapes/biomes
  - Simple shapes
  - Animal-like figures

Key Findings:
- Model size vs training stability tradeoff
- Importance of timestep count
- Batch size impact on training speed
